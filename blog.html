                        var: var has function-level scope. This means that a variable declared with var is
                         function-scoped, and it's accessible throughout the entire function in which it is
                          declared. If declared outside any function, it becomes a global variable and is
                           accessible throughout the entire program. <br><br>
                        let and const: let and const have block-level scope. They are scoped to the nearest
                         enclosing block (typically denoted by curly braces {}), including loops and
                          conditional statements. This means they are not accessible outside of the block

                        null: null is a deliberate absence of any object value. It's often used to indicate
                         that a variable or property should have no value or point to no object. For 
                         example, you might set a variable to null to release memory or to reset a variable's value.
                     <br><br>
                        undefined: undefined is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned
                         a value. It is also the default value of function parameters that are not 
                         provided. It's generally best to avoid assigning undefined explicitly and use it
                          to check for uninitialized variables or missing function arguments.

                    <p class="text-lg font-bold">

                        REST API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It is
                         based on a set of principles and constraints that are intended to provide a 
                         standardized way of interacting with resources over the web. The key principles of REST include:

                        
                        Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the 
                        information necessary to understand and process the request. The server
                         should not store any client state between requests.

                        
                        Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities that communicate through
                         a well-defined interface. This separation allows for scalability and flexibility.

                        
                        Uniform Interface: REST APIs have a consistent and uniform interface, typically
                         using HTTP methods like GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data),
                          DELETE (delete data), etc. Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

                        
                        Resource-Based: In a REST API, everything is considered a resource, which can be represented as a URL. Resources can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods.

                        
                        Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON or XML, and clients can request the representation they prefer.

                        
                        REST APIs are widely used for building web services and web applications, providing
                         a simple and scalable way to interact with data and services over the internet. They are the foundation
                          of many modern web applications and are often used for data retrieval, manipulation, and interaction
                           between different software systems.
